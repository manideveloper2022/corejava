Composition is also called as Has - A relationship

Has-A relationship:
----------------------------
Object inside object
Object as instance variable



Req:
Person has person info and address info
Student has student info and address info




without - has a relation
---------------------------------------------------------------------

- create two classes

class Person:
       id,name,age,streetNo,city,state,country,pin
       
class Student:
       id,firstname,lastname,branch,semno,streetNo,city,state,country,pin
     
  



with has-a:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
- create three classes
- Object as a instance variable.


Address class has streetNo,city,state,country,pin
Person class has adress object as instance variable
Student class has adress object as instance variable


class Address:
    String streetNo, String city, String state, String country, String pin
    
    
class Person{
       int id;
       String name;
       int age;
       Address addr;
       
}    
 
  
    
class Student{
       int id;
       String firstname;
       String lastname;
       int branch;
       int semno;
       Address addr;
}       
   

In future if we need to add additional properties for Address then we need to change Person and Student class.
   
   
person has 3 addresses:
--------------------------


class Person {
       int id;
       String name;
       int age;
       Address presentAddr;
       Address permAddr;
       Address offAddr;
  }
