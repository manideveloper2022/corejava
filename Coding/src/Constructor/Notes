Constructor:
-------------------
- we need to write inside the classs.
- When obj is created Constructor is called automatically.
- With Constructor we can set the data during obj creation.
-initialize the instance variables during obj creation 
  

class Person{
  int id;
  String name;
  ing age;
  
}

Req: create obj + set data


without constr:  [requires 4 lines]
----------------------------------------------------
Person p = new Person(); 

//set the data after obj creation
p.id =1000;
p.name="user1";
p.age=45;


set the data after object creation
initialize the instance variables after obj creation



with constr:  [requires 1 lines]
---------------------------------------------
Person p = new Person(1000,"user1",45);

set the data along with obj creation
initialize the instance variables during obj creation





points:
------------
Constr name is equal to class name.
Constr doesnt have any return type.
we can have any number of constrs in a single class -> constr overloading..
A constr is called only one time for one obj..

Adv:
  - creat obj + set the data in single line.
  - set data during obj creation





syntax for writing constr:
------------------------------------




class Person  
 {

	 int id;
   String name;
   int age;
   // id, name, age are instance variables
   
   
    // zero arg constructor
	public Person() {  
		System.out.println("zero arg constructr");
	}
   
   
   
	// param arg constructor
	public Person(int id, int age, String pName) {  
		this.id = id;
		this.age = age;
		this.name = pName;
	}
	
   
   public void show(){ // this is method
	}
   
   
   
}



Person p = new Person(); // internally calls zero-arg constr  
Person p1 = new Person(2000,23, "user1" ); // internally calls param-arg constr   
Person p2 = new Person(2000,23 );  




 //diff between constr and method:
 --------------------------------------------------------
 1.constr is called one time
 method can be called any no of times
 
 2.constr name = class name
 method  name can be anything
 
 3.contsr doesnt have any return type(not even void)
 method have return type(atleast void) ...
 
 4.cosntr is called during obj creation
  method should be called after obj created.
 
 
5.constr is automatic call
method is explict call
 
6. constr logic -> only initializing instance variables
 method logic -> any logic
 
  


This keyword:

public class Person {
 
	int id;
	String name;
	int age;

 
	public Person(int id, String name , int age ) { 
		this.id = id;  
		this.name = name;
		this.age = age;
	}


}

/*
 instance variables : variables created inside class
 local variables : variables created inside the method or constructor

 * */
//this refer to the current object under execution
//use this keyword , when instance variables names and local variable names are same
