special classes in inheritance:
->abstract class
->interface




Abstract class:
------------------------------
-> should be used only in Inheritance.
-> always a parent class.
->we cannot create object for abstarct class .
-> abstarct class has two types of methods:  
  a) abstract methods
  b) non abstract methods 
 -> If a class has one abstract method then class has to be abstract class...
 
 
 
 
->syntax for abstract class:
--------------------------------

public abstract class RBI{ // class is abstract


 public void display(){
   
   }
 
public abstract void display1(); // method is abstract
  

  
}



observations:
------------------
RBI is a abstract class
display() is a instance method( non abstract method )
display1() is a abstarct method 



 
abstract methods:
------------------
->has only method declaration ; 
->abstract method does not have any logic / no body 
-> abstract method has to be written only in abstract class  
  public abstract void display1();
  
  
  
   Impact:
 --------------
 Overriding the abstract method is mandatory for child class
 
 
 
 The only way to use abstract class is by creating child class
 --> create a class that extends the Abstract class [ only way to use abstract class]  
-->  For a child class overriding is mandatory for the abstract methods,
