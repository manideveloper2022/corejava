Interface:
-> should be used only in inheritance.
->we cannot create object for interface

Interface = 100 % abstract class
->Interface has only abstract methods and only public static final variables.
-> No instance variables + constr 
->interface method cannot be static

In a interface :
 --> 1.public abstract methods
 --> 2.public static final variables.
 
 
 
RBI : interface
SBI : child class for RBI



->syntax for interface class:
 
	public interface RBI {
    
     public static final int count =50;
  		 public abstract void display();
  	   public abstract void show();
  
   }
   
   
 Observations:
 RBI is a interface
 count = static variable
 display() - is a abstract method
 show() - is a abstract method
 
 
 
 
syntax for creating child class for a interface:
------------------------------------------------
//use implements for creating child class

public class SBI implements RBI {
  //overriding the display() and show() are mandatory....
  
}


For a child class:
---------------------------
Use Extends --> normal class+ abstract class
Use implements --> interface  


Interface supports multiple inheritance.
normal class+ abstarct class doesnot supports multiple inheritance.

 Normal class  -> all methods has logic + we can create obj + multiple inherit not suppported
abstract class -> some methods have logic and some meyhods doent have logic + we cannot create obj + multiple inherit not suppported
interface  -> all methods doent have logic + we cannot create obj  + multiple inherit is suppported








RBI : interface
 WorldBank : interface
 SBI is the child class for RBI and WorldBank.
 
 
  RBI.java:
  ------------
public interface RBI {
  public abstract void display();
  public abstract void show();
  
}

WorldBank.java:
---------------
public interface WorldBank {
  public abstract void ppf();
  public abstract void draft();
}



SBI.java:
---------------- [ SBI as child class for  RBI,WorldBank ]
public class SBI implements RBI,WorldBank{
	
//overriding the display() and show()  ppf() and draft()  are mandatory....
	
}
