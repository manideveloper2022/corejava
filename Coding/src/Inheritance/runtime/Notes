public class RBI {

	public void createAcc() {

}




/**
  RBI is parent class
  HDFC is child of RBI
  HDFC is overriding the processLoan() method
  
 */
public class Hdfc extends RBI{

	//overriding method
	public void processLoan() {
		System.out.println("HDFC: 12%");
	}
	
	public void demat() {
		System.out.println("HDFC: demat 13%");
	}
}


Two ways of obj creatin for HDFC:

1.Hdfc h = new Hdfc();


2.create obj for child class and refer by parent class
  RBI r = new Hdfc(); 



There are 3 types of meythods:
	//createAcc() -> is inherited method
	//processLoan() -> overridden method
	//demat()  -> child specific method
