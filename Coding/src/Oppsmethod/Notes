 method/function:
     group of statements/code block Written under a common name

 
 
   write methods inside the class
  write code one time and reuse any number of times
  
    
-> how to call the method
  -> how to write method



  Adv:
  code reusability.
  write code once and reuse any no of times.
  
   
   
   
     
syntax for a method:
------------------------
<scope> <return type> <methodname> (<input args>){
  
  <method body>
  
  
  <return statement>
}



scope -->public/private/protected
returnType -> (if single value needed to Return)use ---- void(no return )  or int/float/long/.....etc 
<methodname> -> any name
<input args> are optional
<return statement> -> is mandatory if returnType is not void or (if multiple value needed to Return)use "Void".



 
-> how to call the method 
-----------------------------------
1. Create the object
2.call the method using the Object




local variable:
--------------------------
local variables are created inside method
memory is allocated in stack
memory is created when method is called
memory is deleted when method execution completes.
scope is only within method.- s [cannot access outside the method]
[ one local variable in one method is visible only till that method; and it is not visible outside the method]





instance variables:
-----------------------------
- declared inside the class
- memory is created in heap
- memory is created when object is created.
- memory is deleted when object is deleted.
- scope till obj availability.
- instance  variables are always associated with object.





ex: class Person{
    int id;
    String name;
    int age;
    
    public void show(){
    int x=90;
    int y =40;
    
    }
}


class: Person
instance method: show()
instance variables: id , name , age
local variables : x ,y
