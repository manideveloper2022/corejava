 static block:
------------------
-> static block is executed only 1 time , during class loading
-> static block contains code  only for initializing the static variables.
-> static block is executed before the constructor.
-> write static block inside the class  
-> static block is a automatic call


purpose:
----------------
to initialize the static variable before anyone uses it


syntax:
--------------

class Data{

 //static variable
 static int count;
 
 //static block
 static{
   <some jaav code>
 
   count = 890;
 }


}




instance variables + instance method + constr   ---> 1 set
(specific data)        ( any logic)     ( initializing the i.v. when obj is created)

static variables + static methods + static block ---> 1 set
(common data)      ( logic for s.v.)  ( initializing the s.v. during class loading)
